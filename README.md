# Interactive Valentine's Day Proposal

Welcome to the Interactive Valentine's Day Proposal app! This project is a fun and playful way to propose a question to someone you love (or just have fun with the animations). It features interactive hearts, stars, tears, a proposal modal, and more!

## Features
